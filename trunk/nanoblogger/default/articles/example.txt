<p>
This is an example article created with the articles plugin. A simple
plugin that scans the <em>articles</em> directory for files ending with
".txt" then checks if the article is new, old, or needs updating and
generates the article accordingly.
</p>
<p>
New articles can be created using the <code>draft</code> action.
<pre>
nb draft [blog_dir]articles/example.txt
</pre>
<p>
The article will be generated the next time the weblog is updated. To
generate the article sooner you can invoke a forced update.
<pre>
nb query main update
</pre>
To remove an article simply rename it's suffix to something
other than ".txt" or remove it from the <em>articles</em> directory.
