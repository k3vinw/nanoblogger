This directory should contain only code provided by contributors. This code is supposed stable and should stand previously under the experimental directory. All the translations will be placed under the contrib directory. Each contribution must wear the name, alias and e-mail address of the contributor. This could be achieve by a comment inside the contributed file, or if the contribution has several files, an author file in a dedicated directory's contributor. The contributor is responsible of the maintenance, bug fixes of the code that it contributes. The project admin may remove or move back the contributed code to the experimental directory if users complains about bugs that the contributor doesn't correct.
