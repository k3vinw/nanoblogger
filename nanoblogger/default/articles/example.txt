This is an example article. The articles plugin provides a simple way
for NanoBlogger to automatically generate and update articles for your
weblog. Creating a new article is easy, create a new ".txt" file with
the "<code>--draft</code>" option inside the <em>articles</em>
directory. Then edit and save the file. To remove an article simply
rename it's suffix to something other than "txt" or remove it from the
<em>articles</em> directory. View the source of this article directly
from <a href="../example.txt">../example.txt</a>.
